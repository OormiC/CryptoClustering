## Description
In this challenge, we used our knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
First, we prepared the data and found the best value for k using the 'Elbow method'. Then we clustered the cryptocurrencies with K-means using the Original
scaled data and then proceeded to optimise the clusters with principal component analysis (PCA) and evaluated the data with and without PCA.
